# **DM164**
I'm a young developer, still learning lots of new stuff and in my free time I code stuff and love to share my work with the community.
I work mostly with webtechnologies and web oriented languages.
Languages I use:

```javascript
let knownLanguages = ['Javascript', 'Java', 'Python', 'C/C++', 'C#', 'Dart/Flutter']
```

## 📂Projects

### 🌸Forget Me Not
Forget Me Not is a desktop application that helps you keep track of all your series, you can add them to your watching later list, currently watching or even finished ones so you never forget the title of that amazing show you watched years ago. That's not all though, Forget Me Not helps you keep in touch with the latest news about shows you watch, lets you take notes, show your friends on Discord what you are watching and lets you see what your friends have on their lists and much more!

### 🌙Dark by DM
Dark by DM, a family of dark themes for different websites on the internet, this is where I started and I'm still keeping the repository up after all these years, I'm not longer as active as I once was on this project but I'm still behind it and every contribution is always welcome!
